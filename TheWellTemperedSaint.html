And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.</p><p class="P7"> </p><p class="P2">By partaking of the fruit, Adam and Eve introduced death into the world.  This was a blessing anticipated by God the Father and necessary for their growth and ours.  As the prophet Jacob said (Jacob 4:3):</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P6">...we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to engraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved brethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first parents.</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P2">Adam and Eve were married before they partook of the fruit of mortality.  In anticipation of their role as parents, God established the indispensable duties and blessings of Father and Mother.  The family unit of government is a harmonious balance of shared power and influence.  The father as head has more control over the goals and direction of his family as a whole, while the mother has more influence and effect on individual members of her family. The father is bound to lead in obeying the laws of God.  His wife is to keep him sure in his duties and warn those who stray from the path of righteousness.  The separate but equally important roles of husband and wife were reaffirmed by Elder Packard in 1977 as he addressed the Saints regarding a proposed Equal Rights Amendment:</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P6">We cannot eliminate, through any pattern of legislation or regulation, the differences between men and women.  </p><p class="P6"> </p><p class="P6">There are basic things that a man needs that a woman does not need. There are things that a man feels that a woman never does feel.</p><p class="P6"> </p><p class="P6">There are basic things that a woman needs that a man never needs, and there are things that a woman feels that a man never feels nor should he.</p><p class="P6"> </p><p class="P6">When God created male and female, He gave each important differences in physical attributes, in emotional composition, in family responsibility. We must protect and honor the vital differences in the roles of men and women, especially in respect to the family.</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P2">Another vital component in being well tempered is realizing what doesn't change when things change.  When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 my high school teacher explained that it had come down for the same reason it had gone up in the first place: to stem a mass exodus.  If an evil empire put up a wall and then tore it down for the same reason, then God could do one thing now and the opposite later for the same purpose.  Israel was scattered and later gathered in the allegory of the olive trees.</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P2">A well-tempered Saint realizes what my father taught us as children, namely that life isn't fair nor was it meant to be.  A key controversy in the War in Heaven was over the definition of equality.  Christ promised to overcome man's fall into mortality and provide everyone with opportunities for eternal growth.  Christ's plan preserved our identity, diversity and freedom to determine how and when such eternal growth will occur.  In contrast, Lucifer wanted everyone to have the same glory, majesty and power as our Father in Heaven.  </p><p class="P2">Moses 4:1--</p><p class="P6">That Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was from the beginning, and he came before me, saying—Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.”</p><p class="P8">D&amp;C 29:36--</p><p class="P6">the devil was before Adam, for he rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine honor, which is my power; and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency.</p><p class="P6"> </p><p class="P2">The war ultimately hinged upon the difference between the words “identical” and “identity”.  Christ understood the principle of equality where all sons and daughters of God were not identical in glory but where everyone had potential to become exalted, have unlimited increase and eternal seed.  In contrast Satan's obsession with our becoming identical to God overlooked the simple reality of God's own eternal growth.  If we attain at some future time the glory and majesty that God has now, then God will likewise have increased in glory.  In Abraham 3:18-19 we read:</p><p class="P2"/><p class="P6"> 18...if there be two spirits, and one shall be more intelligent than the other, yet these two spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other, have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end, they shall exist after, for they are gnolaum, or eternal.</p><p class="P6"> </p><p class="P6"> 19 And the Lord said unto me: These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all.</p><p class="P6"> </p><p class="P8">God's definition of equality regarding His children acknowledges our differences yet realizes the worth of every soul.</p><p class="P8"> </p><p class="P8">May we show mutual respect and regard for each other and seek to be uplifting.</p><p class="P8"> </p><p class="P8">The well-tempered Saint balances the self with the selfless.  We would do well to remember that man is a three-fold being of mind, spirit and body.  As such we are uncreated, procreated and created beings.  Uncreated because our minds and personalities have no beginning.  Procreated because our spirits are the offspring of Heavenly Parents.  Created because our mortal bodies are descendents of Adam.  As created and procreated beings, we worship God as our Father and Jesus Christ as our creator.  As uncreated intelligences we are not God's puppets but have free will.  As King Hezekiah successfully asked God to extend his otherwise shortened life, we can both honor God's will and still plead our own cause in prayer.  Our lives can derive meaning from three important sources.  There is meaning we receive from Heavenly parents, there is meaning we accept from earthly parents, and there is meaning in life that no one else can give us but that which we make for ourselves.  God knew this and in His infinite wisdom and love allowed mankind to fall and sent Christ to redeem us.  Eden represents God's presence and the familiar light we borrowed from God in His presence.  Just as Adam and Eve left the familiar comforts of Eden in order to grow and develop some light of their own in a world of darkness, we too will experience similar departures from the familiar.  What once seemed so obvious to  us, may now seem to require much faith.  When God places new veils over the light we have borrowed from Him, He is not punishing us with confusion, but blessing us with yet another chance to leave our Edens of borrowed understanding and become more like Him.  In developing our own personal and unique  understanding of Eternal truth, we can then shine with a light and meaning of our own that is in harmony God's plan for our eternal and endless growth.</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P2">May we take these words to heart is my prayer, in the Name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P9"> </p><p class="P10">Janeen Brady "Think Beautiful Things"</p><p class="P10"> </p><p class="P10">If you think beautiful things,</p><p class="P10">You will be a beautiful person,</p><p class="P10">Someone I'd like to talk with,</p><p class="P10">You'll be someone I'd like to have around.</p><p class="P10">If you think beautiful things,</p><p class="P10">You will feel the good fairly burst in,</p><p class="P10">Happiness will surround you,</p><p class="P10">You will glow till it might astound you,</p><p class="P10">If you think only beautiful things,</p><p class="P10">All your whole life through....</p></body></html>
