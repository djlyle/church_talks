<h1>Run and Not Be Weary</h1>
<p>
One Saturday summer morning in Payson, UT my family ran a 5k. It was fun to see many familiar faces.  I remember the enthusiasm of my kids, especially one of my sons, for he reminded me of a valuable life lesson that day.  My oldest son is very competitive in sports, such as soccer in which he has a very powerful kick.  He was determined that day to leave everyone in the dust and finish the race as soon as possible.  When the race began he quickly sprinted ahead and was working his way to the front of the pack.  I couldn't keep up with him and stayed behind for a little while with a mass of similarly paced runners.  It wasn't too many minutes later however that I noticed a much slower version of my son walking by the side of the road.  He wasn't as eager to finish the race anymore, but together we walked a ways and then gradually worked into a faster pace to finish.
</p>
<p>
This experience reminded me of that scripture in Mosiah 4:27:
</p>

<blockquote>
27 And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.      
</blockquote>

<p>
Do you notice the tension in this scripture?  Just as a tent is held up by the tension of ropes, there are balancing factors described here.  On the one hand we are told to be diligent in serving god and our fellow man, as detailed in the verses preceding this one. On the other hand we are told not to run faster than we have strength.  God wants each of us to not only finish the race of life but to run it with a vigor and joy that only comes when we pace ourselves to endure to the end.
</p>
<p>
At some point in this marathon of life, we may feel the pains and the burnings of the struggle to endure to the end.  What comfort to know that our Father in Heaven is running beside us, encouraging us back to a healthier and happier pace.  The prophet Isaiah gives us these encouraging words:</p>   
<p>
Isaiah 40:28-31
</p>
<blockquote>
<p> 
 28 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.
</p>
<p>
 29 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.
</p>
<p>
 30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
</p>
<p>
 31 But they that await upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A good race is run at a good pace.  Having both physical and spiritual bodies, a good pace in our race for eternal life is established by  
staying nourished, active and renewed both physically and spiritually.
</p>  
<p>
Physically we are given great advice in the Doctrine and Covenants concerning nourishing, working, and resting our bodies.  We should use moderation in nourishing our bodies and souls.
</p>
In the January 2013 New Era, the church magazine written especially for the youth of the church, Elder Boyd K. Packer stated the importance of moderation in his talk entitled "How to Live the Word of Wisdom":
<blockquote>
<p>Young people, learn to use moderation and common sense in matters of health and nutrition, and particularly in medication. Avoid being extreme or fanatical or becoming a faddist.  For example, the Word of Wisdom counsels us to eat meat sparingly (see D&C 89:12). Lest someone become extreme, we are told in another revelation that "whoso forbiddeth to [eat meat] is not ordained of God" (D&C 49:18).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spiritually we need to remain balanced lest we fall over with despair.  In the October 1974 Ensign, Ezra Taft Benson, then President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles offers the following advice to remain upright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We live in an age when, as the Lord foretold, men's hearts are failing them, not only physically but in spirit. (See D&C 45:26.) Many are giving up heart for the battle of life. Suicide ranks as a major cause of the deaths to college students. As the showdown between good and evil approaches with its accompanying trials and tribulations, Satan is increasingly striving to overcome the Saints with despair, discouragement, despondency, and depression.
</p>
<p>
Yet, of all people, we as Latter-day Saints should be the most optimistic and the least pessimistic. For while we know that "peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion," we are also assured that "the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst." (D&C 1:35-36.)
</p>
<p>
With the assurance that the Church shall remain intact with God directing it through the troubled times ahead, it then becomes our individual responsibility to see that each of us remains faithful to the Church and its teachings. "He that remaineth steadfast and is not overcome, the same shall be saved." (JS-M 1:11.) To help us from being overcome by the devil's designs of despair, discouragement, depression, and despondency, the Lord has provided at least a dozen ways which, if followed, will lift our spirits and send us on our way rejoicing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Benson went on to mention twelve ways to lift our spirits towards the vertical and away from an unbalanced state of despair.  Let me list them briefly:<p>
<ol>
<li>Repent. A man would do well to examine himself to see that he is in harmony with all of God's laws. Every law kept brings a particular blessing. Every law broken brings a particular blight. </li>
<li>Pray. Prayer can put us in touch with God, our greatest source of comfort and counsel.</li>
<li>Serve.  To lose yourself in righteous service to others can lift your sights and get your mind off personal problems, or at least put them in proper focus.</li>
<li>Work.  Work is our blessing, not our doom. God has a work to do, and so should we. Retirement from work has depressed many a man and hastened his death. </li>
<li>Stay healthy. The condition of the physical body can affect the spirit. That's why the Lord gave us the Word of Wisdom. </li>
<li>Read.  Many a man in his hour of trial has turned to the Book of Mormon and been enlightened, enlivened, and comforted.</li>
<li>Seek priesthood blessings.  In a particularly stressful time, or in the anticipation of a critical event, one can seek for a blessing under the hands of the priesthood.</li>
<li>Fast.  A certain kind of devil goes not out except by fasting and prayer, the scripture tells us.  Periodic fasting can help clear up the mind and strengthen the body and spirit.</p>
<li>Have friends.  The fellowship of true friends who can hear you out, share your joys, help carry your burdens, and correctly counsel you is priceless.  Ideally, your family ought to be your closest friends. Most important, we should seek to become the friend of our Father in heaven and our brother Jesus the Christ. </li>
<li>Listen to inspiring music.  Such can fill the soul with heavenly thoughts, move one to righteous action, or speak peace to the soul.</li>
<li>Set Goals. Every accountable child of God needs to set goals, short- and long-range goals. A man who is pressing forward to accomplish worthy goals can soon put despondency under his feet, and once a goal is accomplished, others can be set up. Some will be continuing goals. Each week when we partake of the sacrament we commit ourselves to the goals of taking upon ourselves the name of Christ, of always remembering him and keeping his commandments.</li>
<li>Endure to the end</li>
</ol>
<p>
If we are to run the race of life with vigor we must learn to enjoy the journey itself rather than become so preoccupied with the destination that we lose all joy in the present.  The apostle Marvin J. Ashton summed this up when he said:

<blockquote>
<p>We become actively engaged in the pastime of conditioning ourselves to believe that happiness and achievement are always somewhere in the future.  There is an attitude of tolerating today, even looking past today in anticipation of a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>To people so inclined, the better future may never come.  The pleasant future belongs to those who properly use today.  We need to find the abundant life as we go along.  How can we be happy tomorrow if our "nows" are filled with self-inflicted unhappiness and unwise delays?  Generally speaking, those inclined to count their daily blessings have more to count because they help make more possible as they learn gratitude.  A constant waiting for a brighter future may cause us to lose the beautiful today.  Some spend so much time getting ready to live for an unknown future, too late they discover there is no time to live.  Very often in our anxiousness for the joys of the future we run away from the very things we are wanting and needing today.  An appropriate examination of the passing moment will prove it leads to eternity.  We need to constantly remind ourselves eternity is in process now.</p>
</blockquote>  

May we run the race with vigor and good pace and remember that Men are that they might have joy.  Such will come when we run with a good pace, and remember that we needn't be weary with god at our side.</p>
