<h3>
Always Remember Him
</h3>
<p>
Do you remember the first conference talk Elder Eyring gave as an apostle?  He answered the question: "How can we become more humble?"  His reply was: "Always Remember Him".
</p>
<p> 
When all is said and done, we remember God because we have felt His love.  I recently felt that love again at the temple when I contemplated the creation of this world and the following words in the scriptures: "Let us go down and form man in our image, after our likeness...male and female."  It struck me profoundly that God the Father personally came down and created Father Adam and his wife Eve. No other creation meant that much to Him.
</p>
<blockquote>2 Nephi chapter 2:
<p>22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.</p>
<p>
23 And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.
</p>
<p>24 But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.</p>
<p>25 Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.</p>
<p>
26 And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.

<p>Everyone yearns for a personal answer to the prayer: "Do you love me?  Do I matter at all to you?"  It is the question every child silently asks their father.  It is the question that every spouse asks their partner: "Do you love me?  Do I still matter to you?"  It was the question Abraham's wife Sarah asked of God when she was left barren of children.  It is the question that Enos son of Jacob pondered when he prayed for forgiveness.  It is the question that Joseph in Egypt thought while he rotted in jail until the Butler remembered his prophesy.  
</p>
<p>God's love can give feeling to a part of us that we often forget, our innermost soul.  Divine love can find its way through all one's layers into that innermost soul.</p>
<p>
In the Book of Mormon we read of a manifestation of God's love in the account of Christ's visit to the Nephites:
</p>
<blockquote>
And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.
</blockquote>
<p>
The gospel of Jesus Christ began with the family of Adam and Eve and the sealing power that can bind us to our families for all eternity.
</p>
<p>
It can become difficult in this world of sorrows to remember the love of God.  Boyd K. Packer recently addressed this matter in discussing the importance of pondering the vision the prophet Lehi had concerning the Tree of Life:  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may think that Lehi's dream or vision has no special meaning for you, but it does.  You are in it; all of us are in it.</p>
<p>
Lehi saw:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A great and spacious building (see 1 Nephi 11:35-36; 12:18).</li>
<li>A path following a river (see 1 Nephi 8:20-22).</li>
<li>A mist of darkness (see 1 Nephi 12:17).</li>
<li>An iron rod that led through the mist of darkness (see 1 Nephi 11:24-25).</li>
<li>The tree of life, "whose fruit was desirable to make one happy" (1 Nephi 8:10; see also 1 Nephi 11:8-9, 21-24).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Read the dream or vision carefully; then read it again.
</p>
<p>
If you hold to the rod, you can feel your way forward with the gift of the Holy Ghost, conferred upon you at the time you were confirmed a member of the Church. The Holy Ghost will comfort you. You will be able to feel the influence of angels, as Nephi did, and feel your way through life.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon has been my iron rod.</p>

How can we always remember Christ?
</p>
<p>We learn the perfect patterns of life and the eternities in the temple.  One such pattern we are taught is the perfect method of remembering.  Remembering involves linking or associating the familiar or known with the unfamiliar or unknown.  Our instruction is built upon the familiar example of sustaining our leaders (raising one's right arm to the square).  The left hand learns from the right hand and the right hand learns from the left  hand until the members of Christ attain that knowledge which is beyond the veil, even the lessons of Eternal Life.</p>
<p>Like the coral of the ocean builds upon itself, so do our memories build upon themselves. Hence the admonition to search the scriptures frequently - our understanding can only grow upon what we already understand.  If we continually build up a spiritual coral reef line upon line and precept upon precept (2 Nephi 28:30), the island of our core testimony will be safer from the raging waters.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen</p>
