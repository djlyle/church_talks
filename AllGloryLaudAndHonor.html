<h1>All Glory Laud and Honor</h1>
<p>
Have you ever been on a treasure hunt?  Since our kids were young we have enjoyed hiding a prize such as candy or small gifts and following a chain of clues that lead to the treasure.
</p>
<p>
I've just used the word treasure as a noun, but it has even more eternal significance when applied as a verb.  When asked "What do you treasure?", we might think of a prized possession or a strongly desired achievement.  At the passing of a loved one we reflect on their life and soberly assess our own.  The question becomes "what did they treasure?" and "what have I treasured?"  as well as "what should I treasure more while I still have time?".  
</p>
<p>
Our Father in Heaven lovingly warns us not to over-invest our hearts and desires upon earthly treasures that cannot love us back nor strengthen the ties of healthy relationships.  The difference between heartache and joy eternal comes down to those things upon which we place the most importance.
</p>
<p>
In Matthew 6:21 we read "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." The Lord has instructed us sufficiently on the lasting treasures we can lay up in heaven.  He has given us the key to such lasting treasures in one simple word.  Let me share several scriptures and let you guess at this word before I reveal it to you:
</p>
<p>
Revelations 5:13: And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
</p>
<p>
1 Peter 3:7: Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
</p>
<p>
Exodus 20:12: 
 12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
</p>
<p>
Romans 12:10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
</p>
<p>
The key to lasting treasures in heaven is found in the word "honor".  I've recently been reading a book about using teachings from the bible to strengthen your marriage and family.  It's called "Love is a Decision" and the author Gary Smalley shares the following truths about the word "honor":

<blockquote> 
<p>
During biblical times, the word "honor" carried a literal meaning that has been all but lost by translation and time.  For a Greek living in Christ's day, something of "honor" called to mind something "heavy, or weighty."<sup>6</sup>  Gold, for example, was the perfect picture of something of "honor," because it was heavy and valuable at the same time.
</p>
<p>
For this same Greek, the word "dishonor" would also bring to mind a literal picture.  The word for "dishonor" actually meant "mist" or "steam"<sup>7</sup>  Why?  Because the lightest, most insignificant thing the Greeks could think of was the steam rising off a pot of boiling water, or clouding a mirror on a cold winter day.
</p>
<p>
When we honor particular people we're saying in effect that who they are and what they say carries great weight with us.  They're extremely valuable in our eyes.  Just the opposite is true when we dishonor them.  In effect, by our verbal or nonverbal statements we're saying that their words or actions make them of little value or "light-weights" in our eyes.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scriptures instruct us on the priorities of honor.  First and foremost we should honor God.  When we honor god first, our cup then will run over and fill the lives of those we cherish most with that same love.  
On earth we should honor our spouse foremost followed by our children and family. With regards to our spouse, we must remember that every enduring marriage involves an unconditional commitment to an imperfect person.  That commitment will only have the strength to last when we honor God first.  There is a reason we worship God and not our spouse.  If we place our expectations for wisdom, love, peace and joy upon our husband or wife we will ultimately be disappointed.  Worship demands what only a god can give.  Only god can fill our cup to overflowing.  To expect the same from mortals, whether a husband, wife, children or others will only lead to disappointment and maybe even resentment.  When we worship God as the source of our renewal then we become truly free.  We become free to truly love others, especially our wife or husband.  That freedom comes when we let God rather than man renew us spiritually, emotionally, mentally and physically.  There is truly no way to heaven without God's help and he has provided it through his son Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>Opportunities to honor god and our fellow man are abundant if we are ready and willing.  We honor the Savior by partaking of the sacrament worthily and reverently.  We honor our spouse by listening with love, forgiving their shortcomings and showing interest in them.  We honor our children by attending their activities, expressing appreciation for their contributions and uniqueness, and showing gentle tenderness when they are in need of comfort.  In terms of our time, we try to schedule things around our family rather than the other way around.
</p>
<p>I still have memories of my early childhood.  As a little boy I knew I was about to get spanked and so I ran to the bathroom and stuffed my behind with toilet paper to soften the blow.  When my dad saw the toilet paper sticking out of my pants he started to laugh and just gave me a hug.  I knew I wasn't going to get off the hook if I was naughty again but I knew that dad loved me.  Parents who honor their children with loving discipline tempered with mercy and tenderness will often find their children honoring them in return.
</p>
<p>
My oldest daughter has honored her family by learning German, her grandfather's native tongue and the language I spoke on my mission for the church in Berlin.  She has enjoyed teaching her siblings how to pray in German.  May I share with you the basic elements of a german prayer?  "Dear Heavenly Father" can be expressed as "Lieber himmlischer Vater".  "We ask thee" becomes "wir bitten dich".  "We thank thee" is uttered as "wir danken dir".  The word for blessing is "Segnung".  We close the prayer with "Im Namen Jesu Christi, Amen".
</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be difficult to honor others.  Honor does not excuse sin, but it provides genuine love regardless of the cost.  Honor involves kindness.  Kindness is communicating that someone is valuable through our actions.</p>
<p>
Jesus taught us how to honor by example.  Matthew 8:3 gives the touching story of his touching the leper.  To touch a leper was risking a deadly disease, but the Savior of mankind had the power and love to honor all men with love and kindness.  I would like you to think of that loving touch of the Savior on the leper as I read my son Spencer's favorite poem:
</p>
<p>Poem of The Touch of the Master's Hand</p>

<pre>
'Twas battered and scarred, 
And the auctioneer thought it 
hardly worth his while 
To waste his time on the old violin, 
but he held it up with a smile.

"What am I bid, good people", he cried, 
"Who starts the bidding for me?" 
"One dollar, one dollar, Do I hear two?" 
"Two dollars, who makes it three?" 
"Three dollars once, three dollars twice, going for three,"

But, No, 
From the room far back a gray bearded man 
Came forward and picked up the bow, 
Then wiping the dust from the old violin 
And tightening up the strings, 
He played a melody, pure and sweet 
As sweet as the angel sings.

The music ceased and the auctioneer 
With a voice that was quiet and low, 
Said "What now am I bid for this old violin?" 
As he held it aloft with its' bow.

"One thousand, one thousand, Do I hear two?" 
"Two thousand, Who makes it three?" 
"Three thousand once, three thousand twice, 
Going and gone", said he.

The audience cheered, 
But some of them cried, 
"We just don't understand." 
"What changed its' worth?" 
Swift came the reply. 
"The Touch of the Masters Hand."

And many a man with life out of tune 
All battered with bourbon and gin 
Is auctioned cheap to a thoughtless crowd 
Much like that old violin

A mess of pottage, a glass of wine, 
A game and he travels on. 
He is going once, he is going twice, 
He is going and almost gone.

But the Master comes, 
And the foolish crowd never can quite understand, 
The worth of a soul and the change that is wrought 
By the Touch of the Masters' Hand.
